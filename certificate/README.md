## Installation

Copy the contents of the ZIP file into a folder.

Install the required libraries using the `composer` command line:

`composer install`

If you have a webserver installed, go to the folder using your browser of choice, e.g.:

http://localhost/certificate

You should hopefully see the included PDF along with text dynamically added in the spaces.
